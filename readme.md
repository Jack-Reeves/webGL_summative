## Controls 

The camera works by a toggle, using the '1' key. In it's initial state you can use the arrow
keys to adjust the pitch and yaw of the camera. In the second state (after pressing '1') you 
can adjust the position of the camera also using the arrow keys, with up and down shifting in 
the Y-plane and the left and right arrows shifting in the X-plane. In both states the shift and 
ctrl keys can be used to move the camera in the Z-plane.

The following keys are used to animate furniture:
* O, P: Opens and closes the cupboard
* W, A, S, D, Q, E: Animates the lamp (see html page for more specific instructions)
* K, L: Opens and closes the drawer underneath the TV set.
